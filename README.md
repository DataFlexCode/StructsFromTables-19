# StructsFromTables-19
 
Structs From Tables ReadMe
==========================

VERSION 2.0
===========

REQUIRES
========

DataFlex 19.0 or higher.

To tell the truth, I have no idea if the above is actually true.  The program was
orginally written for Visual DataFlex 11 (remember that?), but at Clive Richmond's
request (the zip file on the Data Access forums having become corrupt) I migrated
it forward to the current 19.0 version and after a few hours fiddling, got it to
work under that, so that's what I am saying is required, since it would be a bit
of a waste of effort to start checking it out in the versions between 11 and 19
(too many to even count easily!).

There were a whole bunch of changes from the original, since we now do not use 
the Windows Registry to hold much of the information it did in VDF 11.

AFAICS it works OK.


DESCRIPTION
===========

StructsFromTables is a DataFlex program which generates 
structs (available since VDF 11.0) from your database tables, and also
global methods for working with them.

The interface consists of a Windows dialog, containing a form, a
grid and a number of buttons.

The form allows you to select the file that the structs and methods will
be generated in.  By default this is .\AppSrc\TableStructs.pkg in your
current workspace, but you can change it whatever you want.

The grid will contain a list of tables from the current workspace's
FileList.cfg, and, if the file you are working with already exists, the
currently generated entries will be already checked for you, so that you
don't inadvertently lose any you are currently using.

You check the tables you want to generate structs and methods for, then
click "Generate", saying "Yes" to the "Continue?" prompt, and "OK" to the
"Done" notification.

The structs and methods (global procedures and functions) for the tables
you check will then be generated in the file shown in the form at the
top of the dialog - you can open it in the studio and look at them, but
DON'T edit the generated file manually!  (Well, you can do what you like
of course, but don't then complain you were not warned!)

For each table you chose there will be:

   1. A STRUCT having the same layout as the table: 't<TableName>'.

   2. A FUNCTION to move data from the file buffer to a struct variable and
      return that variable: '<TableName>_BufferToStruct'.

   3. A PROCEDURE which takes a struct variable and moves its data to the
      file buffer: '<TableName>_StructToBuffer'.

   4. A FUNCTION which loads a struct variable from the Current_Field_Value
      properties of a passed Data Dictionary handle and returns it:
      '<TableName>_DDToStruct'.

   5. A PROCEDURE which takes a struct variable and a Data Dictionary handle
      and sets the DD Field_Changed_Value properties from the struct data:
       '<TableName>_StructToDD'.


These allow you to move data to and from DataFlex file buffers (2 & 3) and
struct variables of the associated type (1), or to and from Data Dictionary
properties (4 & 5) and the struct variables.

Usage Example:
--------------

(using the Order Entry Sample workspace)

//==============================================

Use Windows.pkg
Use cApplication.pkg
Use TableStructs.pkg

Object oApplication is a cApplication
End_Object

Open Customer

Procedure ShowCust Global Integer iNum tCustomer tThisOne

   ShowLn "=================================="

ShowLn ("ShowCust, record" * String(iNum))

   ShowLn "Number:      " (String(tThisOne.Customer_Number))
   
   ShowLn "Name:        " tThisOne.Name
   
   ShowLn "Address:     " tThisOne.Address
   
   ShowLn "City:        " tThisOne.City
   
   ShowLn "State:       " tThisOne.State
   
   ShowLn "=================================="
   
   ShowLn
   
End_Procedure  // ShowCust

Procedure DoStuff Global Integer iNum
   tCustomer tCust

   Get Customer_BufferToStruct to tCust

   Send ShowCust iNum tCust
End_Procedure  // DoStuff

Integer giRec
String  gsAKey

Clear Customer

For giRec From 1 to 5
   Find gt Customer by Index.2
   If (Found) Send DoStuff giRec
   Else Break
Loop

InKey gsAKey

Abort

//==============================================

Here the outer code finds Customers in a loop, fires DoStuff, which calls the
Customer_BufferToStruct function in TableStructs.pkg to fill a variable of type
tCustomer (defined in TableStructs.pkg) from the file buffer, then passes that
variable on to ShowCust to display.


NOTES
=====

I put it on the "Tools" pull-down in my DataFlex Studio, so I can run it
whenever the situation calls for it.  It is after all a development utility.

To do that, in the Studio menu select "Tools" -> "Configure Tools Menu...",
then add an entry "Structs from tables" with the "Command" value pointing
to the StructsFromTables.exe file with a Parameters value of "<workspace>"
(without the quotes), then click "OK".

That will allow you to fire up the program with whatever workspace you are working
in being the default, which saves a lot of messing around selecting workspaces or
filelists and output locations.


WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?
==============================

There are at least two reasons for using this kind of approach (I know there
are at least two, because it wasn't until I encountered the second one that I
was prompted to write the program) - other people may come up with others.

-----

The first is a web services scenario where you want to pass complete records, or
even sets of records (which would be arrays of structs), between applications.

One example of this might be the synchronization of data between multiple sites,
using a VDF Web Service at the "remote" end and a web service client at the
local end.

The generated structs would be used to define the web service, while that
definition would then be exposed as WSDL allowing the web service client to map
to it.  The web service client could then use the methods in TableStructs to
load its buffer or data dictionary data into the struct to be passed.

[NOTE: there is an issue here, because of the way DataFlex generates its web service
client class packages: it renames the structure it detects in a service's WSDL
by prefixing it with "tWS".  The generated web service client package would 
therefore need to be modified after generation to (a) Use TableStructs.pkg,
(b) change the names of the structs used (Find and Replace "tWSt" with "t" will
do in simplest case, where the table-structs are the only ones involved), and
(c) comment out the structs defined in the package itself (or at least the ones
made redundant by TableStructs.pkg).  Once you know what you are doing this boils
down to a couple of minutes work for each "generation" of a web service client.]

As records are modified on the local system, the web service client can request
that the record be changed (or inserted, or deleted, but you don't need a struct
for the last - just a unique key) by the service, passing it a struct containing
the modified record.

-----

The second is a situation where you want to encapsulate logic working on data,
from the usual finding and updating logic, probably for reasons of reuse, but
also for clarity.

An example would be components for reading data into a system from multiple
different external sources.  The reading and mapping logic would be different
for each source, but the updating logic would be the same for all.  The data
mapping components would send their data to the update logic via structs with
the same layout as the database tables.  The update logic would be completely
ignorant of the reading and mapping logic; the reading logic would only have to
worry about what it was reading; only the mapping logic would need to know both
sides of the story, but even it wouldn't need to know the internals of the
update component.

-----

In both cases, it wouldn't be terribly difficult to manually write the structs
and methods, but if modifications were then made to the involved tables, the
maintenance overhead - and the concomitant probability of introducing errors -
would be considerable.  With StructsFromTables you can just regenerate your
TableStructs.pkg file after making any database changes, significantly reducing
the maintenance overhead.


SOURCE
======

The source consists of two source files:

	StructsFromTables.src - the program source
	StructFromTable.dg    - the on-screen bit: does all of the work

You should be able to put the two source files into the AppSrc directory of a
project (or create a new project for them and put them in there). 

You can then, from the DataFlex Studio menu, select "Project" --> "Add Project..."
and select "StructsFromTables.src", then just compile (F5 or F8) and you should
be in business.


LIMITATIONS
===========

The program will not currently handle BINARY or OVERLAP fields.  In most cases
the lack of overlaps will not be an issue, as the underlying fields will be
handled.  I'm not sure what to do about BINARY fields... could base64encode them
I suppose, but not today.


KNOWN BUGS
==========

None at the moment, but if people start to use it I feel sure I'll be hearing
about them.
